# JackedUp

Workout application that uses a deck of cards to randomly select exercises for the user to perform. 

Users can assign a type of exercise (push-ups, sit-ups, burpes, etc) to each of the suits ( &hearts;, &diams;, &spades;, &clubs; ) and then they can iterate through a deck of cards to perform the exercises.

## Next Steps:
 - [ ] Adapt into a PWA
 - [ ] Add transitions between cards to make it more obvious to the user that they have gone to the next card in line
 - [ ] Allow users to skip and end workout earlier
 - [ ] Add logic for workout difficulty
 - [ ] Refresh desktop design
